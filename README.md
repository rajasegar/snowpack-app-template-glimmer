# snowpack-app-template-glimmer

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

This is a [Snowpack](https://snowpack.dev) application template for [glimmer](https://glimmerjs.com).
It uses the [glimmer-experimental](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-experimental) libraries and tools with component templates.

## Usage
This is how you can use this template with Snowpack to create glimmer apps:
```
npx create-snowpack-app my-awesome-glimmer-app --template snowpack-app-template-glimmer
```

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/master/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
